# social-network-api-cw2

## Description

The purpose of this project was to explore how a social network works and how that data is stored! This project was awesome to give me some more practice with Insomnia and it was really fun to create my own API!

## Installation

Just use node index.js!

## Usage

Simply type in node server.js and run the routes through insomnia! You can use get routes to see your user, their thoughts, friends and reactions to those thoughts! You can also delete users, reactions, friends and thoughts as well!

Heres a link to how it works! (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iX3Mh5d5RA9XDnfZlAZLOlNG9Fh3_o_2/view?usp=sharing)
